.SH NAME
bayonne \- manage GNU bayonne application server.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bayonne
.B command
.RI [ arguments... ]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The bayonne command allows one to interact with a running bayonne daemon
instance on the current machine.  This can be used to create management shell
scripts or to perform basic service operations, using the bayonne fifo control
interface.  Normally this command would be used only by root or someone in an
admin group that the bayonne daemon is running under.   If the bayonne daemon
is started by an ordinary user, the command can be used by the same user to
control that daemon instance.

.TP
.BI concurrency " level"

.SH "EXIT STATUS"
Normally exit status is 0 if the request was successfully processed by the
bayonne service daemon.  An exit status of 0x indicates an error in the
bayonne utility, such as invalid argument parsing.  An error of 1x indicates
some communication failure with the server, and a error of 2x is related to
errors on server processed requests.
