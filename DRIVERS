Some Bayonne drivers are very general purpose.  However, Bayonne drivers will
also be created for solving very specific integration issues and/or to use
unique features of specific telephony platforms.  We are merging the goals of
the original Babylon PBX integration server project with bayonne.

"sipapps"

This driver can be used generically to serve applications over SIP and RTP in
conjuction with an existing SIP server or SIP capable telephone system. Sipapps
offers specific scripting features for use and integration with GNU sipwitch.
This driver also offers specific support for automatic uuid-based registration
and contact authentication when used in conjunction with sipwitch and assumes
other sipwitch specific behaviors and features by default.  In the future we
may offer different (additional) sip drivers for Bayonne, for example to
support 3g IMS platform uses, or for use with different SIP IP-PBX's that may
have very different behaviors and needs.

"vpbapi"

This is based on version 4 of the Voicetronix API, which supports analog DSP
Voicetronix voice cards and Sangoma (Voicetronix) span cards.  The vpbapi
driver is a rather generic driver the will be a foundation for creating similar
platform specific drivers for legacy analog integrated key systems like the
Panasonic DBS, and perhaps also for integration with traditional legacy digital
PBX's like the Fujitsu F9600.  As a "generic" reference driver, vpbapi may also
offer an optional SMDI capability, and some basic configuration of dial and
feature access codes. If we can include other platform specific features within
this driver rather than using a separate driver, we will do that also.
